# Dual Vault Configuration Status

## âœ… Configuration Updated

Your Claude Desktop configuration has been updated to support dual vaults!

### What's Changed:

1. **Two Vault Mounts**:
   - **Core Vault**: `C:/Users/Steve/Obsidian/StevesVault` â†’ `/core-vault`
   - **Project Vault**: `Project_Context/vault` â†’ `/project-vault`

2. **Dual Vault Mode Enabled**:
   - `VAULT_MODE=dual` - Activates dual vault system
   - `ENABLE_CROSS_VAULT_SEARCH=true` - Search both vaults
   - Weighted search: 30% core, 70% project

3. **Fixed Container References**:
   - `chromadb-memory` (was `chromadb`)
   - `postgres-memory` (was `postgres`)

## How It Works Now

### When You Store Information:
```
"Remember that I always use TypeScript for new projects"
â†’ Auto-categorized to CORE vault (personal preference)

"This project uses Next.js 14 with App Router"
â†’ Auto-categorized to PROJECT vault (project-specific)
```

### When You Search:
```
"What's my preferred testing framework?"
â†’ Searches BOTH vaults
â†’ Core vault: "You prefer Jest with React Testing Library"
â†’ Project vault: "This project uses Vitest"
```

### Templates:
- CoachNTT templates will be created in your core vault
- Available across all projects
- Located at: `StevesVault/CoachNTT Templates Read Only/`

## Next Steps

1. **Restart Claude Desktop** for changes to take effect

2. **Test the dual vault system**:
   ```
   "Show me my vault configuration"
   "Store in core: I prefer tabs over spaces"
   "What are my coding preferences?"
   ```

3. **Templates will be created** when the system initializes

## Important Notes

- Your OpenAI API key is already configured
- Both ChromaDB and PostgreSQL must be running
- Session logs go to project vault by default
- Core vault is for permanent knowledge
- Project vault is for project-specific information

## Troubleshooting

If MCP server doesn't appear after restart:
1. Check Docker Desktop is running
2. Ensure services are up: `docker-compose ps`
3. Check logs: `docker logs chromadb-memory`

The dual vault system is now fully configured! ðŸŽ‰
