# Dual Vault Implementation Summary

## What We Accomplished

### 1. **Configuration Updates**
- ✅ Renamed `Vault` folder to `vault` (lowercase) to follow standard conventions
- ✅ Updated `config.ts` to use `./vault` as default project vault path
- ✅ Added dual vault configuration to `.env` file with all necessary environment variables
- ✅ Fixed Claude Desktop config volume mount paths to use the new `vault` location

### 2. **Code Implementation**
- ✅ Created `src/tools/dual-vault-tools.ts` with five new dual vault tools:
  - `promote_to_core`: Promote memories from project to core vault
  - `get_vault_stats`: Get statistics about both vaults
  - `switch_project`: Switch to a different project vault
  - `search_cross_vault`: Search across both vaults with weighted results
  - `categorize_memory`: Preview where content would be stored

- ✅ Updated existing memory tools (`store_memory`, `recall_memories`) to be vault-aware:
  - Added `vault` parameter to both tools
  - Default is `auto` which uses intelligent categorization
  - Can explicitly specify `core` or `project`

- ✅ Updated tool registry to include vault parameters and dual vault tools

### 3. **Key Features**
- **Auto-categorization**: System intelligently routes memories based on content patterns
- **Cross-vault search**: Search both vaults simultaneously with weighted results
- **Memory promotion**: Move valuable project memories to your core knowledge vault
- **Environment-based configuration**: All paths come from environment variables, no hardcoding

### 4. **Configuration Details**
```env
# Dual Vault Configuration
VAULT_MODE=dual
CORE_VAULT_PATH=C:/Users/Steve/Obsidian/StevesVault
PROJECT_VAULT_PATH=./vault
DEFAULT_VAULT_CONTEXT=project
ENABLE_CROSS_VAULT_SEARCH=true
VAULT_SEARCH_STRATEGY=weighted
CORE_VAULT_WEIGHT=0.3
PROJECT_VAULT_WEIGHT=0.7
```

### 5. **Usage Examples**

#### Store memory with auto-categorization:
```json
{
  "tool": "store_memory",
  "arguments": {
    "content": "Always use environment variables for configuration",
    "context": "best_practice",
    "vault": "auto"
  }
}
```

#### Search across both vaults:
```json
{
  "tool": "recall_memories",
  "arguments": {
    "query": "authentication patterns",
    "vault": "both",
    "limit": 10
  }
}
```

#### Promote valuable memory to core:
```json
{
  "tool": "promote_to_core",
  "arguments": {
    "memoryId": "mem_123456",
    "reason": "Universal best practice for all projects"
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Restart Docker containers** to apply the new configuration
2. **Test the dual vault system** with some sample memories
3. **Monitor categorization accuracy** and adjust patterns as needed

The dual vault system is now fully integrated and ready to use!
