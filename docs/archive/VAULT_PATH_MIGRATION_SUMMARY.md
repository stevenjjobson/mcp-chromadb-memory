# Vault Path Migration Summary

## Overview

We successfully migrated all vault references from `Project_Context/vault/` to `./vault/` throughout the project. This fixes the issue where the vault index was only showing 2 files instead of the full vault structure.

## Changes Made

### 1. Source Code Updates

#### src/index.ts
- Line 1080: `indexPath: 'Project_Context/vault/VAULT_INDEX.md'` → `'./vault/VAULT_INDEX.md'`
- Line 1721: Roadmap path from `Project_Context/Implementation Roadmap.md` → `Planning/roadmaps/Implementation Roadmap.md`
- Line 1794: Vault index message updated to use `./vault/VAULT_INDEX.md`

#### src/services/vault-index-service.ts
- Line 25: `indexPath = 'Project_Context/vault/VAULT_INDEX.md'` → `'./vault/VAULT_INDEX.md'`
- Line 312: Roadmap path updated to `Planning/roadmaps/Implementation Roadmap.md`
- Lines 350, 398: Implementation roadmap references updated
- Line 647: Implementation guides path updated
- Line 721: Base vault path from `'./Project_Context/vault'` → `'./vault'`

### 2. Documentation Updates

#### CLAUDE.md
- 16 references to `Project_Context/` replaced with `vault/`
- All document storage paths updated
- Session logs, architecture, and knowledge paths corrected

#### README.md
- 16 references to `Project_Context/` replaced with appropriate paths
- Project structure diagram updated
- All quick reference links corrected
- Added prominent Dual Vault Architecture section with visual diagram

#### CLAUDE_CODE_VS_DESKTOP_CONFIG.md
- Docker volume mount updated from `Project_Context/vault` to `vault`

### 3. Configuration Files

#### claude_desktop_config_*.json
- `claude_desktop_config.example.json`: Volume mount updated
- `claude_desktop_config_dual_vault.json`: Project vault mount updated
- `claude_desktop_config_fixed.json`: Volume mount updated
- `claude_desktop_config_current.json`: Already correct (no changes needed)

### 4. File System Changes

- Removed empty `Project_Context/` directory
- All vault content remains in `./vault/` directory

### 5. New Documentation

Created comprehensive Dual Vault Quick Start Guide at:
- `docs/guides/dual-vault-quickstart.md`

Enhanced README.md with:
- Prominent Dual Vault Architecture section
- Visual diagram of dual vault system
- Quick setup instructions
- Links to dual vault documentation

## Benefits

1. **Vault Index Now Works**: Shows all files in the vault instead of just 2
2. **Cleaner Structure**: Removed unnecessary Project_Context nesting
3. **Better Documentation**: Dual vault architecture is now prominently featured
4. **Consistent Paths**: All references throughout the codebase are now consistent

## Next Steps

1. **Test Vault Access**: Run the server and verify vault index shows correct file count
2. **Consolidate Index Files**: Merge index.ts, index-fixed.ts, and index-coachntt.ts
3. **Update Docker Image**: Rebuild Docker image with corrected paths
4. **Verify Dual Vault**: Test dual vault functionality with both core and project vaults

## Migration Command Summary

```bash
# After pulling these changes:
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d chromadb postgres
# Restart Claude Desktop to load updated configuration
```

The vault path migration is now complete!
