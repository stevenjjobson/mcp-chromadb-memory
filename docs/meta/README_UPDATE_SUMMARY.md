# README Update Summary

**Date**: 2025-07-12
**Purpose**: Fix outdated information and conflicting statements across all README files

## Changes Made

### 1. Main README.md (Root)
- **Fixed Path References**:
  - `MEMORY_USAGE_GUIDE.md` → `docs/guides/memory-usage.md`
  - `HYBRID_STORAGE_GUIDE.md` → `docs/guides/hybrid-storage.md`
  - `CODE_INTELLIGENCE_GUIDE.md` → `docs/guides/code-intelligence.md`
- **Standardized Service Names**:
  - Changed all references from `chromadb`/`postgres` to `coachntt-chromadb`/`coachntt-postgres`
  - Fixed container names from `chromadb-memory`/`postgres-memory` to match docker-compose.yml
- **Updated Database Credentials**:
  - Changed from `mcp_user`/`mcp_memory` to `coachntt_user`/`coachntt_cognitive_db`
- **Added Missing Reference**:
  - Added link to Hook Scripts Guide

### 2. CONTRIBUTING.md
- Fixed roadmap path from `./Project_Context/Implementation%20Roadmap.md` to `./vault/Planning/roadmaps/Implementation%20Roadmap.md`

### 3. vault/README.md
- Changed title from "Project_Context" to "Vault"
- Updated folder structure diagram from `Project_Context/` to `vault/`
- Fixed `.env` configuration example from `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH=./Project_Context` to `./vault`

### 4. CoachNTT/README.md
- Added clarification about current implementation status
- Specified that backend is operational but frontend UI needs implementation

### 5. docs/README.md
- Added references to newly organized documentation:
  - Meta Documentation section
  - Testing Documentation section

### 6. File Reorganization
- Moved `DOCUMENTATION_ORGANIZATION.md` → `docs/meta/`
- Moved `FUNCTIONALITY_TEST_REPORT.md` → `docs/testing/`

## Consistency Achieved

All README files now consistently use:
- **Service Names**: `coachntt-chromadb` and `coachntt-postgres`
- **Database**: `coachntt_cognitive_db` with `coachntt_user`
- **Vault Path**: `./vault` (not Project_Context)
- **Documentation Paths**: Correct references to files in `docs/guides/`

## Remaining Recommendations

1. Consider adding more detailed content to vault subdirectory READMEs (Architecture, Development, Knowledge, etc.)
2. Update any scripts or configuration files that might still reference old service names
3. Ensure all example configurations in documentation match the actual `.env.PRODUCTION` settings
