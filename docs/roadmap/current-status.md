## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### Database Architecture Decision (NEW)
- **Issue**: ChromaDB throttling on bulk operations
- **Solution**: Hybrid PostgreSQL + ChromaDB approach
- **Benefits**:
  - 60x faster code indexing (60s → <1s for 10k symbols)
  - 20x faster exact search (200ms → <10ms)
  - ACID transactions for critical operations
  - Rich SQL queries for complex relationships
- **Implementation**:
  - PostgreSQL for structured data and metadata
  - ChromaDB retained for pure semantic search
  - pgvector extension for embeddings in PostgreSQL

### Dual-Instance Development Environment
- **PRODUCTION**: Port 8000 - Live system with real data
- **DEVELOPMENT**: Port 8001 - Isolated testing environment
- Separate Docker containers and .env files
- Environment management script: `scripts/env-manager.sh`

### Hierarchical Memory System
- **Architecture**: Three-tier system with automatic migration
- **Configuration**: Feature flag `TIER_ENABLED=true`
- **Implementation Files**:
  - `src/memory-manager-enhanced.ts` - Core tier logic
  - `src/services/migration-service.ts` - Automatic migration
  - Various tier management scripts in `scripts/`

### Session Logging Updates
- Filename format: YYYY-MM-DD (full year)
- Vault path: Project-local `./Project_Context/vault/Sessions/`
- Auto-start enabled in production

### Code Intelligence Implementation
- **Architecture**: Claude Code optimized design with PostgreSQL backend
- **Core Features**:
  - Symbol indexing in PostgreSQL (no throttling)
  - Streaming response system
  - Code pattern detection via SQL
  - Natural language queries with hybrid search
- **Implementation Strategy**:
  - Phase 0: Database foundation (NEW)
  - Phase 1: Code symbol memory type
