## üñ•Ô∏è Claude Code Setup & Usage

### Initial Setup

1. **Navigate to Project** [WSL Recommended]:
   ```bash
   # [WSL]
   cd /mnt/c/Users/Steve/Dockers/mcp-chromadb-memory
   ```

2. **Start Required Services**:
   ```bash
   # [WSL or Windows]
   docker-compose up -d coachntt-chromadb coachntt-postgres
   ```

3. **Launch Claude Code**:
   ```bash
   # [WSL] - This automatically uses .mcp.json
   claude
   
   # [Windows CMD/PowerShell] - From project directory
   claude
   ```

4. **First Time Setup**:
   - Claude Code will detect `.mcp.json` and prompt: "This folder has MCP servers configured. Would you like to use them?"
   - Select **Yes** to enable the memory server

### Using Memory Features in Claude Code

#### Store Important Information
```
"Remember that the PostgreSQL connection uses coachntt_user with password coachntt_pass"
"Store this code pattern: always use hybrid storage for performance"
```

#### Recall Information
```
"What do you remember about PostgreSQL configuration?"
"Show me stored code patterns"
"What decisions have we made about the architecture?"
```

#### Session Logging (Automatic)
- Sessions automatically log to: `vault/Sessions/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- No action needed - it's automatic with `AUTO_START_SESSION_LOGGING=true`

#### Code Intelligence
```
"Index the current codebase"
"Find all functions that handle memory storage"
"Show me the symbol relationships for HybridMemoryManager"
"What code patterns exist in the memory system?"
```

### Advanced Claude Code Commands

#### Vault Management
```
"List all available vaults"
"Backup the current vault"
"Switch to project vault"
```

#### State Management
```
"Capture the current development state"
"List saved states"
"Restore state from yesterday"
```

#### Memory Analysis
```
"Analyze memory access patterns"
"Show memory tier statistics"
"What memories should be migrated?"
```

**[Windows Only]**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Full path: `C:\Users\Steve\AppData\Roaming\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

### Basic Configuration

1. **Edit Configuration File** [Windows]:
   ```powershell
   # [Windows PowerShell]
   notepad $env:APPDATA\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Start Services** [Windows PowerShell]:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\Steve\Dockers\mcp-chromadb-memory

   ```

4. **Restart Claude Desktop**:
   - Close Claude Desktop completely
   - Reopen Claude Desktop
   - Look for "CoachNTT.ai" in the MCP server list (bottom of sidebar)

### Verifying Connection

In Claude Desktop, type:
```
Can you check your MCP connection status?
```

You should see "CoachNTT.ai" listed as connected.

## üîß Key Features & How to Use Them

### 1. Hierarchical Memory System

**Working Memory** (0-48 hours)
- Stores immediate context
- Fastest retrieval
- Example: "Remember this bug fix approach for later today"

**Session Memory** (2-14 days)
- Recent development sessions
- Example: "What did we discuss about authentication last week?"

**Long-term Memory** (14+ days)
- Permanent knowledge
- Example: "Store this as a best practice for our project"

### 2. Code Intelligence Features

**Index Your Codebase**:
```
"Index all TypeScript files in the src directory"
"Update the code symbol index"
```

**Search for Symbols**:
```
"Find the definition of HybridMemoryManager"
"Show all functions that call storeMemory"
"What files import the config module?"
```

**Analyze Patterns**:
```
"What code patterns exist in our error handling?"
"Find similar implementations to this function"
```

### 3. Session Logging

**Automatic Logging**:
- Every conversation is logged to `vault/Sessions/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Includes timestamps, messages, and tool usage

**Review Sessions**:
```
"Show me yesterday's session log"
"What did we work on this week?"
```

### 4. Vault Management

**Project Vault** [Default]:
- Location: `./vault` (relative to project)
- Contains project-specific knowledge

**Switch Vaults**:
```
"List available vaults"
"Switch to the documentation vault"
"Create a backup of the current vault"
```

### 5. State Capture & Restore

**Save Development State**:
```
"Capture the current state as 'refactoring-auth-v2'"
"Save our current context before switching tasks"
```

**Restore Previous State**:
```
"List available saved states"
"Restore the state from 'refactoring-auth-v2'"
"Show me what changed since the last state capture"
```

---

## üöÄ Advanced Usage Patterns

### 1. Development Workflow Pattern

```
Morning:
1. "Show me a summary of yesterday's work"
2. "What tasks are still pending?"
3. "Restore yesterday's final state"

During Development:
- "Remember this approach for handling errors"
- "Store this SQL query pattern"
- "Index the changes I just made"

End of Day:
- "Capture state as 'eod-2025-01-11'"
- "Summarize today's progress"
- Session auto-saves on exit
```

### 2. Code Review Pattern

```
"Index the pull request files"
"Find all similar patterns in our codebase"
"Remember this review feedback for future PRs"
"What are our code review best practices?"
```

### 3. Debugging Pattern

```
"Store this error message and stack trace"
"What similar errors have we encountered?"
"Remember the solution: [explanation]"
"Find all code that could cause this error"
```

### 4. Knowledge Building Pattern

```
"Store this as a best practice for API design"
"What design patterns have we established?"
"Create a memory about PostgreSQL optimization"
"Show me all stored architectural decisions"
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Claude Code Issues

**MCP Server Not Detected**:
```bash
# [WSL] Ensure you're in the project directory
pwd  # Should show: /mnt/c/Users/Steve/Dockers/mcp-chromadb-memory

# Check .mcp.json exists
ls -la .mcp.json
```

**Connection Errors**:
```bash
# [WSL or Windows] Check services
docker-compose ps
docker logs coachntt-postgres
docker logs coachntt-chromadb
```

### Claude Desktop Issues

**Server Shows as Disconnected**:
1. Check Docker services are running
2. Verify network name matches: `mcp-chromadb-memory_coachntt-platform-network`
3. Ensure OpenAI API key is set correctly
4. Check Docker logs: `docker logs $(docker ps -q --filter "ancestor=mcp-chromadb-memory-mcp-memory")`

**Path Issues**:
- Windows paths in config must use forward slashes: `C:/Users/Steve/...`
- Volume mounts are case-sensitive

## ‚ö° Performance Tips

### 1. Optimize Memory Queries
```
# Be specific with context
"Recall memories about authentication in the user service"  # ‚úÖ Good
"What do you remember?"  # ‚ùå Too broad
```

### 2. Use Exact Search for Known Content
```
"Search for exact match: 'PostgreSQL connection pool'"
"Find memories containing 'HybridMemoryManager' exactly"
```

### 3. Batch Operations
```
"Index all files that changed in the last commit"
"Store these 5 related concepts together: [list]"
```

### 4. Regular Maintenance
```
Weekly:
- "Analyze memory access patterns"
- "Show memories that should be migrated"
- "Backup the vault"

Monthly:
- "Show memory statistics and fragmentation"
- "Find duplicate or similar memories"
```
