# Development Sessions

This folder contains development session logs and conversation histories.

## Important Note

These sessions may contain:
- Experimental features being tested
- Potential errors and debugging sessions
- Incomplete implementations
- Test data that should not be used in production

## Naming Convention

Same as production sessions: `YYYY-MM-DD-Project-Name-DEVELOPMENT.md`

The `-DEVELOPMENT` suffix in the project name helps distinguish these sessions from production sessions.

## Folder Structure

```
