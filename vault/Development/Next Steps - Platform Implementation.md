# Next Steps - Platform Implementation

## Immediate Actions (Today)

### 1. Create Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/platform-transformation
git push -u origin feature/platform-transformation
```

### 2. Set Up Project Tracking
- [ ] Create GitHub Project board
- [ ] Add issues for each major component
- [ ] Set up milestones for each phase
- [ ] Configure branch protection rules

### 3. Initialize TypeScript Interfaces
Create `src/types/platform.types.ts` with all platform interfaces:
- VaultInfo, VaultConfig, VaultType
- StateCapture, WorkingContext, StateMetadata
- TierConfig, TierName, MigrationReport
- Pattern, Decision, CodeSnippet
- BackgroundService, ServiceStatus

## Day 1 Implementation Tasks

### Morning Session (4 hours)
1. **Project Setup**
   - Review all documentation
   - Set up development environment
   - Configure VS Code for the project
   - Create initial file structure

2. **Type Definitions**
   - Create comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
   - Define all enums and constants
   - Set up shared types module
   - Add JSDoc documentation

### Afternoon Session (4 hours)
1. **Configuration Enhancement**
   - Extend config.ts with platform settings
   - Add vault configuration schema
   - Add tier configuration schema
   - Create migration configuration

2. **Initial Tests**
   - Set up test framework
   - Create test utilities
   - Write interface validation tests
   - Verify configuration loading

## Week 1 Focus Areas

### Vault Manager (Days 2-3)
- Core vault operations
- Registry management
- Backup/restore functionality
- Path validation and security
- Multi-vault coordination

### State Manager (Days 3-4)
- Context capture mechanism
- State serialization format
- Compression implementation
- Restore validation
- Diff algorithm

### Configuration System (Days 4-5)
- Enhanced schema validation
- Environment variable mapping
- Docker secrets integration
- Configuration migration
- Default value management

## Critical Path Items

These must be completed in order:

1. **Type System** - All other code depends on interfaces
2. **Configuration** - Services need config to initialize
3. **Vault Manager** - State manager depends on vaults
4. **Memory Manager v2** - Core platform functionality
5. **Migration Service** - Enables tier system

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Test Coverage Goals
- Vault Manager: 95%
- State Manager: 95%
- Memory Manager v2: 90%
- Services: 85%
- Overall: 90%

### Integration Test Scenarios
1. Multi-vault switching
2. State capture/restore cycle
3. Memory tier migration
4. Session processing pipeline
5. Background service coordination

## Documentation Requirements

### Code Documentation
- JSDoc for all public methods
- Interface documentation
- Usage examples in comments
- Error handling documentation

### User Documentation
- Getting Started guide
- Migration guide from v1
- API reference update
- Troubleshooting guide
- Architecture diagrams

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **ChromaDB compatibility**
   - Test multi-collection performance early
   - Have fallback to single collection

2. **Memory usage**
   - Profile memory consumption
   - Implement cleanup strategies

3. **Migration complexity**
   - Keep v1 code operational
   - Gradual migration approach

### Schedule Risks
1. **Feature creep**
   - Stick to roadmap scope
   - Defer nice-to-haves to v2.1

2. **Testing delays**
   - Write tests alongside code
   - Automate where possible

## Success Metrics

### Week 1 Deliverables
- [ ] Complete type system
- [ ] Vault manager functional
- [ ] State manager functional
- [ ] Enhanced configuration
- [ ] 50% test coverage

### Week 2 Deliverables
- [ ] Hierarchical memory system
- [ ] Migration service running
- [ ] Pattern recognition basic
- [ ] 75% test coverage

### Week 3 Deliverables
- [ ] Full platform integration
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Performance optimized
- [ ] 90% test coverage

## Development Environment

### Required Tools
- Node.js 20+
- Docker Desktop
- VS Code with extensions:
  - TypeScript
  - ESLint
  - Prettier
  - GitLens
  - Docker

### Recommended VS Code Settings
```json
{
  "typescript.tsdk": "node_modules/typescript/lib",
  "eslint.autoFixOnSave": true,
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": true
  }
}
```
