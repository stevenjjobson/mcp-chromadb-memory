**Subject Lines (A/B test):**
- "Cut [Company]'s AI costs by 94% with 2 weeks of work"
- "Your grep searches are costing you $X million/year"
- "Quick question about [Company]'s API costs"

**Email Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

I'm a developer who discovered that standard grep/glob searches in AI coding tools waste 94% of API tokens.

Quick example from my own project:
- Searching for "authenticate function"
- Before: 45,000 tokens ($1.35)
- After: 2,400 tokens ($0.07)
- Same results, 30x faster

For [Company], this could mean ~$XM in annual savings.

I built a simple hook-based solution that routes searches to indexed lookups instead. Takes about 2 weeks to implement.

Worth a 15-minute call to see the numbers?

Best,
Steve

P.S. Here's a calculator showing the waste: [link]

### To VCs/Investors

**Subject:** "Portfolio company opportunity: 94% AI cost reduction"

```
Hi [Name],

I know you've invested in [Company1] and [Company2]. I've discovered they're both wasting ~94% of their AI API budget on inefficient code searches.

Real data:
- Current: grep sends 45,000 tokens per search
- Optimized: indexed lookup uses 2,400 tokens
- Same results, 30x faster

Across your portfolio, this could save $10M+/year.

I'm a solo developer who found this optimizing my own costs. Happy to show any of your portfolio companies how it works.

### To Developer Advocates at OpenAI/Anthropic

**Subject:** "Helping your customers reduce API costs by 94%"

```
Hi [Name],

I've been using [OpenAI/Claude] API and discovered that most coding tools waste 94% of tokens on inefficient searches.

Example:
- Grep for code: 45,000 tokens
- Optimized search: 2,400 tokens
- Same results

This inefficiency costs your customers millions unnecessarily. I built a simple optimization that fixes it.

Would [OpenAI/Anthropic] be interested in:
1. Sharing this with enterprise customers?
2. Including in best practices docs?
3. Introducing me to customers who'd benefit?

Happy to show you the data.

### Connection Request
```
Hi [Name], I discovered a way to cut AI API costs by 94% for coding tools. Given your role at [Company], thought you'd find this interesting. Would love to connect and share what I found.
```

### Follow-up Message
```
Thanks for connecting! As mentioned, I found that AI coding tools waste 94% of their API budget on inefficient searches.

Real example:
Before: 45,000 tokens per code search
After: 2,400 tokens
Same results, 30x faster

For [Company], this could save ~$XM/year.

### Thread Starter
```
ðŸ¤¯ I just discovered AI coding tools waste 94% of their API budget

A simple grep search for "class UserManager":
- Tokens used: 15,000
- Cost: $0.45
- Time: 2.5 seconds

With basic optimization:
- Tokens: 200
- Cost: $0.006  
- Time: 0.05 seconds

Here's how ðŸ§µ

### Direct Reply to Complaints
When you see someone complaining about API costs:
```
I found a way to cut those costs by 94%! Instead of grep sending entire files to the LLM, index symbols locally first. 

Reduced my searches from 45K tokens to 2.4K tokens. Same results, 30x faster.

Happy to share how if interested.

### r/programming Post

Title: "TIL: AI coding assistants waste 94% of API tokens on searches"

I was debugging why my Claude integration was so expensive and discovered this:

Every code search runs grep and sends ENTIRE FILE CONTENTS to the LLM. A search for "authenticate function" was using 45,000 tokens ($1.35).

I built a simple PostgreSQL index of code symbols. Now the same search uses 2,400 tokens ($0.07).

The crazy part? This would work for any AI coding tool. Copilot, Cursor, Codeium - they're all doing the same inefficient thing.

Some napkin math:
- 10M developers
- 20 searches/day
- $0.40 waste per search
- = $29B/year in unnecessary costs

Am I missing something or is this as crazy as it seems?

## The "Warm" Approach

### After They Engage with Content
```
Hi [Name],

Saw you [liked/shared/commented on] my post about AI API cost optimization.

I've actually implemented this for my own project and got the 94% reduction working reliably. Happy to walk through how it works if [Company] is interested.

No sales pitch - just one developer sharing a useful discovery.

Best,
Steve

### When They Ask for More Info
```
Thanks for your interest! Here's a quick breakdown:

1. Current approach: Grep searches send full file contents to LLM (expensive, slow)
2. Optimized: Index symbols in PostgreSQL, search there first (cheap, fast)
3. Results: 94% fewer tokens, 30x faster

I have a working implementation using hook scripts. Takes about 2 weeks to integrate into most systems.

Would you prefer:
- Technical deep-dive (30 min)
- Business impact focus (15 min)
- Hands-on demo (20 min)

What works for your calendar?
```

### When They're Skeptical
```
Totally understand the skepticism! I didn't believe it either until I saw my own API bills drop.

Here's my actual logs showing before/after: [screenshot]

The key insight: grep is great for text, terrible for structured code when you're paying per token.

Happy to run a test on your codebase to show real numbers. No obligation - I'm honestly just excited to share this discovery.
