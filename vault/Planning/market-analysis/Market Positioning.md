#### 2. High Intelligence / Low Integration
**Current Players**:
- MemGPT: Powerful but academic
- LangChain: Flexible but requires engineering
- Custom Solutions: Powerful but expensive

**Market Gap**: These require significant effort to integrate

#### 3. Low Intelligence / High Integration
**Current Players**:
- Obsidian: Great UX, manual process
- Notion: Collaborative, limited AI
- Copilot: Integrated, no persistence

**Market Gap**: Good integration but lack intelligence

#### 4. Low Intelligence / Low Integration
**Current Players**:
- Basic note-taking apps
- Text editors
- Markdown files

**Market Gap**: Serve basic needs only
