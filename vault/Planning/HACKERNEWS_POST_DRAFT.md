### Version 1: Technical Discovery Story

```
I was building a memory system for Claude when I noticed something odd. My code searches were consuming 45,000 tokens for simple queries like "find authenticate function."

That's $1.35 per search.

I added some basic instrumentation and discovered:
- Grep "class UserManager" = 15,000 tokens, 2.5 seconds
- find_symbol "UserManager" = 200 tokens, 0.05 seconds

Same results. 98.7% fewer tokens. 50x faster.

The problem? AI coding tools use grep/glob for everything, sending entire file contents to LLMs. But if you index symbols in PostgreSQL first, you can do exact lookups in milliseconds.

Some napkin math:
- GitHub Copilot: ~10M users, ~20 searches/day = 200M searches
- At $0.40 waste per search = $80M/day wasted
- That's $29B/year in unnecessary API costs

I built a simple hook system that intercepts grep/glob calls and routes them to optimized tools. The code is surprisingly simple:

```python
if is_code_search(pattern):
    return f"Use find_symbol query='{query}' type=['class']"
```

My ChromaDB project now runs 94% cheaper. My searches are instant instead of 3+ seconds.

The crazy part? This optimization would work for any AI coding tool. Cursor, Codeium, Copilot - they're all making the same expensive mistake.

I put together a cost calculator so you can see what your queries actually cost: [link]

Am I missing something here, or is the entire industry really wasting billions on inefficient searches?
```

### Version 2: Direct Problem/Solution

```
TL;DR: AI coding tools waste 94% of API tokens on searches. Here's proof and a fix.

THE PROBLEM:
Every time you search code in an AI assistant, it runs grep and sends entire file contents to the LLM. This is insanely expensive and slow.

Real example from my logs:
- Query: "find authenticate function"  
- Method: Grep over codebase
- Tokens: 45,000
- Cost: $1.35
- Time: 3 seconds

THE SOLUTION:
Index code symbols in PostgreSQL, then search there first.

Same query after optimization:
- Method: find_symbol
- Tokens: 2,400  
- Cost: $0.07
- Time: 0.1 seconds

94% cost reduction. 30x performance gain.

THE IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Parse code files once, extract symbols
2. Store in PostgreSQL with type, location, signature
3. Intercept grep/glob calls with a hook
4. Route to indexed search instead

Here's the core hook logic: [code snippet]

THE IMPACT:
If GitHub Copilot implemented this:
- Current: ~$100M/year in API costs
- Optimized: ~$6M/year
- Savings: $94M/year

Every AI coding tool has this problem. Cursor, Codeium, Tabnine, all of them.

I built a calculator to show the waste: [link]

The code is simple. The savings are massive. Why isn't everyone doing this?
```

### Version 3: Ask HN Approach

```
Ask HN: Why do AI coding tools use grep instead of indexed search?

I've been investigating why my AI coding assistant was so expensive to run, and I discovered something that doesn't make sense.

When you search for code (like "find UserManager class"), these tools:
1. Run grep across your entire codebase
2. Send ALL matching file contents to the LLM  
3. Pay for tens of thousands of tokens
4. Wait 3+ seconds for results

But if you index symbols first (PostgreSQL + simple parser), you can:
1. Look up symbols directly
2. Send only relevant definitions
3. Use 94% fewer tokens
4. Get results in <100ms

I tested this on my own project:
- Before: 45,000 tokens per search ($1.35)
- After: 2,400 tokens per search ($0.07)
- Same results, just faster and cheaper

Is there a technical reason why Copilot, Cursor, etc. don't do this? 

It seems like they're leaving hundreds of millions on the table. The implementation is straightforward - I did it in a weekend with hook scripts.

What am I missing?

## Best Practices for HN

1. **Post Tuesday 9am EST** (highest traffic)
2. **Engage genuinely** in comments for first 2 hours
3. **Have backup evidence** ready (screenshots, logs)
4. **Don't oversell** - let the numbers speak
5. **Be ready for skeptics** - have technical details ready

## Expected Comments & Responses

**"This won't work at scale"**
> "PostgreSQL can handle billions of symbols. With proper indexing, lookups are O(1). Here's my benchmark data..."

**"You're not considering X"**
> "Good point! I'd love to understand X better. In my testing, it still came out 90%+ cheaper even with [consideration]"

**"Why hasn't someone done this?"**
> "That's exactly what I'm wondering. Maybe there's institutional inertia, or they're focused on other features?"

## Follow-up Actions

When it hits front page:
1. Update your LinkedIn: "On HN front page"
2. Tweet the link with key stats
3. Email any interested companies: "We're on HN front page discussing the optimization"
4. Prepare for inbound inquiries

## The Goal

You're not selling anything. You're starting a discussion about massive inefficiency in the industry. Let curiosity and FOMO drive engagement.
