# Hacker News First-Time Posting Guide

## Quick Start for New HN Users

### 1. Create Your Account
1. Go to https://news.ycombinator.com
2. Click "login" in the top right
3. Click "create account"
4. Username tips:
   - Use your real name (builds trust)
   - Or a consistent handle you use elsewhere
   - Keep it professional
5. Email is optional but recommended for password recovery

### 2. Understand HN Culture
- **What HN loves**: Technical discoveries, clever hacks, genuine questions
- **What HN hates**: Marketing, hype, buzzwords, obvious self-promotion
- **Golden rule**: Be curious, not salesy

### 3. Best Times to Post

**Optimal windows (Pacific Time):**
- Tuesday 6-7 AM PT (9-10 AM ET) 
- Wednesday 6-7 AM PT
- Thursday 6-7 AM PT

**Why these times work:**
- West Coast engineers checking HN with morning coffee
- East Coast engineers in mid-morning break
- European engineers checking before end of day

**Avoid:**
- Weekends (low traffic)
- Monday (people catching up)
- After 2 PM PT (declining engagement)

### 4. Choose Your Post Type

For your API optimization discovery, you have three options:

#### Option A: "Ask HN" (RECOMMENDED)
- Best for generating discussion
- Positions you as curious, not promotional
- Higher engagement rate
- Format: "Ask HN: [Your Question]"

#### Option B: "Show HN"
- Only if you've built the calculator
- Must be something people can try
- Format: "Show HN: [What You Built]"

#### Option C: Regular Link/Text Post
- More hit or miss
- Better after you have karma
- No special prefix

### 5. Crafting Your Title

**Title Rules:**
- Cannot edit after posting (choose carefully!)
- 80 character limit
- No emoji, all caps, or excessive punctuation

**Formulas that work:**
1. Question format: "Why do AI coding tools waste 94% of API tokens?"
2. Discovery format: "I found out AI code searches cost 20x more than necessary"
3. Specific format: "Grep vs indexed search: 45,000 tokens vs 2,400"

**Your best title options:**
- "Ask HN: Why do AI coding tools use grep instead of indexed search?"
- "Ask HN: Am I wrong that AI code search wastes 94% of tokens?"
- "AI coding tools are wasting millions on inefficient searches"

### 6. Writing Your Post

**Structure for "Ask HN":**
```
1. Brief context (1-2 sentences)
2. What you discovered (3-4 sentences)
3. Specific data/example
4. Your genuine question
5. Optional: Link to more info
```

**Keep it:**
- Under 2000 characters
- Focused on one main point
- Technical but accessible
- Genuinely curious

### 7. The First 2 Hours (Critical!)

**Minute 0-5:**
- Post your submission
- Immediately add a clarifying comment
- Share the direct link with NO ONE (HN detects brigading)

**Minute 5-30:**
- Refresh every 2-3 minutes
- Respond to EVERY comment thoughtfully
- Upvote helpful comments (after you have 10+ karma)

**Minute 30-120:**
- Keep engaging with substantive responses
- Add technical details as requested
- Stay humble and curious

**What determines success:**
- Early upvote velocity
- Comment engagement
- Time on page
- Click-through rate (if link post)

### 8. Comment Strategy

**Great comment starters:**
- "That's an interesting point about X..."
- "I hadn't considered Y, but in my testing..."
- "You're absolutely right. I found that..."
- "Great question! Here's what I discovered..."

**Never say:**
- "Thanks for the upvote"
- "Please share this"
- "Check out my product"
- "As I said in the post..."

### 9. Handling Criticism

You WILL get skeptics. Here's how to handle them:

**Skeptic**: "This won't work at scale"
**You**: "Valid concern! At what scale do you think it breaks down? In my testing with X symbols..."

**Skeptic**: "Big companies must have considered this"
**You**: "That's exactly what puzzles me. Maybe there's an architectural constraint I'm missing?"

**Skeptic**: "Your numbers seem wrong"
**You**: "Here's my exact methodology: [details]. What would you test differently?"

### 10. Using Your Moment

If your post takes off:

1. **Update your profile**:
   - Add LinkedIn/Twitter
   - Brief bio mentioning the discovery

2. **Prepare for inbound**:
   - People will email you
   - Check LinkedIn messages
   - Have a calendar link ready

3. **Don't over-optimize**:
   - Stay in the comments
   - Don't start selling
   - Let them come to you

### 11. If It Doesn't Take Off

**Common reasons:**
- Bad timing
- Title wasn't clear
- Too promotional
- Just bad luck

**What to do:**
- Don't delete and repost (bannable)
- Wait at least a week
- Try a different angle
- Build karma through comments first

### 12. HN Etiquette

**Do:**
- Assume good faith
- Stay technical
- Admit when you're wrong
- Share data/code
- Thank people for insights

**Don't:**
- Get defensive
- Use marketing speak
- Argue about downvotes
- Promote aggressively
- Create multiple accounts

### 13. Your Secret Weapons

1. **You're genuinely curious** - This is gold on HN
2. **You have real data** - Not theoretical
3. **You built a solution** - Hackers respect builders
4. **You're saving money** - Engineers love efficiency
