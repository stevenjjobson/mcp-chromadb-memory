# CoachNTT VSCode Extension Development Log

## January 10, 2025 - Icon Addition and Documentation

### 🎯 Objectives Completed
1. ✅ Added activity bar icon (user-created SVG)
2. ✅ Rebuilt and repackaged extension
3. ✅ Created comprehensive usage guide
4. ✅ Documented API key configuration
5. ✅ Clarified current capabilities vs planned features

### 📦 Build Updates
- Added `resources/activity-bar-icon.svg` for sidebar visibility
- Package size remains optimized at ~752 KB
- Extension version: 1.0.0

### 📝 Documentation Created
- `USAGE_GUIDE.md` - Complete user guide with:
  - Installation instructions
  - API key configuration (OpenAI & ElevenLabs)
  - Feature usage examples
  - Troubleshooting section
  - Current limitations

### 🔍 Current State Analysis

#### What's Working
- ✅ **MCP Client**: Full stdio-based connection to server
- ✅ **Memory Operations**: Store, search, browse memories
- ✅ **Audio Synthesis**: ElevenLabs text-to-speech integration
- ✅ **Memory Tiers**: Working/Session/Long-term organization
- ✅ **UI Components**: Activity bar, sidebar panels, status bar

#### What's Not Implemented
- ❌ **Chat Interface**: No conversational UI yet
- ❌ **AI Agent Integration**: No direct Claude/LLM chat
- ❌ **Code Intelligence**: Features defined but not wired up
- ❌ **Voice Input**: Only output (TTS) is implemented

### 🔧 Configuration
The extension requires two API keys set in VSCode settings:
- `coachntt.server.openaiApiKey` - For memory embeddings
- `coachntt.server.elevenLabsApiKey` - For voice synthesis

### 📌 Important Notes
The extension provides infrastructure for conversational AI but lacks the actual chat interface. Users can:
- Store and search code memories
- Use text-to-speech for code narration
- Browse hierarchical memory tiers
- But cannot have conversational interactions yet

## January 9, 2025 - Initial Setup and Testing

### 🎯 Objectives Completed
1. ✅ Built and packaged the VSCode extension
2. ✅ Created distributable .vsix file (coachntt-vscode-1.0.0.vsix)
3. ✅ Fixed icon path configuration issue
4. ✅ Analyzed project structure and architecture
5. ✅ Established development location strategy

### 📦 Build Process
```bash
# Dependencies installed successfully
npm install

# TypeScript compiled without errors
npm run compile

# Extension packaged with vsce
vsce package
# Output: coachntt-vscode-1.0.0.vsix (3.1 MB)
```

### 🔧 Configuration Fixes
- Updated `package.json` icon path from `resources/icon.png` to `media/Icon.png`
- Icon file exists at: `C:\Users\Steve\Dockers\mcp-chromadb-memory\CoachNTT\vscode-extension\media\Icon.png`

### 🏗️ Architecture Analysis

#### Current State
- **Minimal Implementation**: Basic placeholder functionality
- **Commands Registered**: All 18 commands defined but show info messages only
- **Mock UI**: Memory tree view with hardcoded tier structure
- **No MCP Integration**: Despite dependencies, no actual server connection

#### Planned Architecture (from README)
```

│   ├── services/        # MCP client, audio playback
│   ├── providers/       # Tree data, webview providers

### 📋 Key Context from Root Project

#### Memory System Types (`src/types/platform.types.ts`)
- Tier names: 'working' | 'session' | 'longTerm'
- Vault management interfaces
- State capture for context preservation
- Service monitoring types

#### Configuration Pattern (`src/config.ts`)
- Environment-based config (PRODUCTION/DEVELOPMENT)
- Feature flags for tiers, code intelligence
- Session logging settings
- Secret management via Docker/env vars

#### MCP Tools
- Memory tools: search_exact, search_hybrid, get_compressed_context
- Audio tools: To be implemented in CoachNTT
- Code intelligence tools: Available from root

### 🚀 Next Steps for Development

1. **Implement MCP Client Service**
   - WebSocket connection to MCP server
   - Message handling for stdio protocol
   - Tool invocation methods

2. **Build Audio Playback Service**
   - Queue management
   - Playback controls
   - Progress tracking

3. **Create Memory Explorer Provider**
   - Real-time data from MCP server
   - Tier-based organization
   - Search and filter capabilities

4. **Implement Settings UI**
   - Connection configuration
   - Audio preferences
   - Memory management options

### 🎨 Development Strategy

**Location**: Continue all development in `/CoachNTT/vscode-extension/`
- Maintains clean separation from core platform
- Allows independent testing and deployment
- Follows specialized implementation pattern

**Integration Points**:
- Import types from root `src/types/`
- Connect to CoachNTT MCP server (not root)
- Share database infrastructure
- Follow root configuration patterns

### 📝 Installation Instructions

For testing the current build:
1. Open VSCode
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Extensions: Install from VSIX..."
3. Select `coachntt-vscode-1.0.0.vsix`
4. Look for "CoachNTT" in status bar
5. Test commands via Command Palette

### 🔍 Files Modified Today
