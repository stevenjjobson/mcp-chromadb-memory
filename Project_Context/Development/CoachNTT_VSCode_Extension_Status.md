# CoachNTT VSCode Extension - Development Status

**Date**: January 9, 2025  
**Status**: Initial Setup Complete ✅

## Summary

Successfully built and packaged the CoachNTT VSCode extension for testing. The extension is now installable via the generated .vsix file and shows basic functionality with placeholder implementations.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Build Infrastructure
- ✅ Dependencies installed (including @modelcontextprotocol/sdk)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation working
- ✅ VSIX packaging successful (3.1 MB distributable)

### 2. Fixed Issues
- ✅ Corrected icon path in package.json (media/Icon.png)
- ✅ All 18 commands properly registered
- ✅ Extension activates without errors

### 3. Architecture Analysis
Identified gap between planned architecture and current implementation:
- **Planned**: Sophisticated service-oriented design with providers and views
- **Current**: Single extension.ts file with placeholder functionality
- **Action**: Ready to implement the planned architecture

## Current Capabilities

### Working Features
- Extension activation/deactivation
- Status bar item with brain icon
- Memory tree view (mock data showing 3 tiers)
- Command palette integration
- Context menu for editor selections

### Placeholder Features
All commands show info messages but lack implementation:
- Server connection/disconnection
- Memory storage and search
- Audio synthesis and playback
- Session management
- Configuration UI

## Integration Points Identified

From root project analysis:
1. **Type System**: Use platform.types.ts for consistency
2. **MCP Tools**: Integrate with memory and audio tools
3. **Configuration**: Follow root project patterns
4. **Tier System**: Implement working/session/longTerm structure

## Next Development Phase

### Priority 1: Core Services
```typescript
src/services/
├── mcp-client.ts      // WebSocket MCP connection
├── audio-service.ts   // Audio queue and playback
└── memory-service.ts  // Memory CRUD operations
```

### Priority 2: UI Components
```typescript
src/providers/
├── memory-tree-provider.ts  // Real memory data
├── audio-queue-provider.ts  // Playback queue
└── webview-provider.ts      // Rich UI panels
```

### Priority 3: Integration
- Connect to CoachNTT MCP server
- Implement real memory operations
