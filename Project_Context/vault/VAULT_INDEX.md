## Memory System Features
### Implemented
- ✅ ChromaDB integration for semantic memory storage
- ✅ Multi-factor memory retrieval (semantic, recency, importance, frequency)
- ✅ Automatic session logging to Obsidian
- ✅ Template system with webhook imports
- ✅ Hierarchical vault structure generation
- ✅ Vault index with health monitoring

### In Progress
- 🔄 Memory health diagnostics
- 🔄 Startup visibility system
- 🔄 Real-time vault updates

### Planned
- ⏸️ Three-tier memory architecture (working, session, long-term)
- ⏸️ Pattern recognition and learning
- ⏸️ Multi-vault support with hot-swapping
- ⏸️ Background consolidation services

## System Recommendations
- ✅ System is healthy and ready for use
- 💡 Consider implementing file watcher for real-time updates
- 💡 Add memory consolidation for long-term storage
- 💡 Implement actual memory statistics (currently using mock data)
