## Key Architectural Principles

1. **Hierarchical Memory Organization**
   - Three-tier system for optimal performance
   - Time-based migration between tiers
   - Automatic consolidation

2. **Project-Integrated Knowledge**
   - Vault lives with code
   - Version controlled documentation
   - Git-aware memory links

3. **Stateful Context Management**
   - Complete context preservation
   - Multi-device synchronization
   - Time-travel capabilities

4. **Intelligent Processing**
   - Automatic session extraction
   - Pattern recognition
   - Importance assessment
