# MCP ChromaDB Memory Server - Proposed Functionality Report

## Executive Summary

The MCP ChromaDB Memory Server evolves from a simple memory storage system into a comprehensive **Cognitive State Management Platform** that intelligently captures, organizes, and retrieves development knowledge while maintaining full project context across sessions, devices, and team members.

This transformation follows the [[Platform Approach - Cognitive State Management]], establishing a foundation for intelligent knowledge management that goes beyond traditional tools to become an integral part of the development workflow.

## Core Functionality Overview

### 1. **Hierarchical Memory System with Time-Delta Management**
- **Three-tier architecture**: Working (0-48h), Session (24h-14d), Long-term (7d+)
- **Automatic migration**: Memories move between tiers based on age and access patterns
- **Sliding windows**: 24-hour overlaps prevent data loss during transitions
- **Performance boost**: 50-70% faster queries through tier-specific optimization

### 2. **Project-Integrated Obsidian Vault**
```
Project_Context/vault/
├── Sessions/          # Auto-captured development logs
├── Architecture/      # Design decisions & patterns
├── Knowledge/         # Solutions, snippets, gotchas
└── Implementation/    # Progress tracking
```
- **Version controlled**: Knowledge evolves with code
- **Self-documenting**: Sessions automatically build documentation
- **Git-aware**: Links memories to commits, branches, and PRs

### 3. **Intelligent Session Processing**
- **Automatic extraction** from Claude Code sessions:
  - Decisions → High importance memories
  - Code snippets → Reusable templates
  - Achievements → Proven solutions
  - Tool patterns → Workflow optimization
- **Cross-referencing**: Links related sessions and memories
- **Pattern recognition**: Identifies recurring problems/solutions

### 4. **API-Based Vault Management**
```typescript
// Core vault operations
setVaultPath(path: string)
switchVault(vaultId: string)
listVaults(): VaultInfo[]
backupVault(): backupId
restoreVault(backupId: string)
```
- **Multi-project support**: Instant context switching
- **Team collaboration**: Shared knowledge bases
- **Backup/restore**: Full disaster recovery
- **Hot-swapping**: Zero-downtime vault changes

### 5. **Stateful Capture System**
- **Complete context preservation**:
  - Active memories and working context
  - Open questions and pending decisions
  - Current focus and hypotheses
- **Time travel**: Restore exact mental state from any point
- **Multi-device sync**: Continue seamlessly across devices
- **Collaborative states**: Share context with team members

### 6. **Advanced Memory Features**
- **Consolidation**: Merges similar memories (>85% similarity)
- **Decay scoring**: Time-weighted importance adjustment
- **Context prefixes**: Domain-specific embedding enhancement
- **Smart filtering**: MongoDB-style queries with metadata

### 7. **Background Intelligence Services**
- **Memory migration**: Hourly tier optimization
- **Pattern learning**: Identifies successful approaches
- **Consolidation**: Daily deduplication
- **Vault synchronization**: Real-time updates
- **Metrics collection**: Usage analytics

## Key Differentiators

### From Basic Memory Storage to Cognitive Platform

| Basic Memory Server | Enhanced Cognitive Platform |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Single collection | Three-tier hierarchy |
| Manual storage | Automatic extraction |
| Simple queries | Multi-factor scoring |
| Isolated memories | Interconnected knowledge graph |
| Static storage | Dynamic optimization |
| Single context | Multi-project/state management |

## Technical Capabilities

### Memory Operations
- **Store**: Autonomous importance assessment
- **Recall**: Context-aware multi-tier querying
- **Consolidate**: Automatic deduplication
- **Migrate**: Time-based tier transitions
- **Extract**: Session content parsing

### Vault Operations  
- **Create**: Project-specific knowledge bases
- **Switch**: Instant context changes
- **Backup**: Scheduled snapshots
- **Sync**: Multi-device coordination
- **Share**: Team collaboration

### State Operations
- **Capture**: Full context preservation
- **Restore**: Time-travel to any state
- **Compare**: Diff between states
- **Share**: Collaborative debugging
- **Analyze**: Pattern recognition

## Use Case Examples

### 1. **Solo Developer**
```
Morning: switchVault('current-project')
→ Restored yesterday's context instantly
→ Continue debugging where left off
→ Session auto-logs progress
Evening: State captured for tomorrow
```

### 2. **Team Collaboration**
```
Alice: captureState('stuck-on-auth-bug')
→ Shares state URL with Bob
Bob: restoreState(aliceState)
→ Sees exact context and attempts
→ Solves and updates shared vault
```

### 3. **Multi-Project Consultant**
```
9am: switchVault('client-a-project')
→ Full context loaded
11am: switchVault('client-b-urgent')
→ Different domain, clean context
2pm: switchVault('personal-learning')
→ Lunch break learning tracked
```

### 4. **Learning & Growth**
```
Vault: 'rust-learning'
→ Tracks understanding progression
→ Links resources to concepts
→ Shows knowledge gaps
→ Suggests next topics
```
