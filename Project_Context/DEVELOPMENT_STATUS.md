# Development Status - MCP ChromaDB Memory Platform

## Current Version
**v1.5** - Enhanced Memory System with Dual-Instance Development

## Overview
The MCP ChromaDB Memory Server is being transformed from a basic memory storage tool into a comprehensive Cognitive State Management Platform. This document tracks the current development status.

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. Enhanced Memory System
- **Exact Search**: O(1) string matching with keyword indexing
- **Hybrid Search**: Combines exact and semantic search (40/60 default)
- **Token Optimization**: 50-90% compression while preserving content
- **Access Pattern Tracking**: Hot/warm/cold tier recommendations
- **Multi-factor Retrieval**: Semantic (40%), Recency (30%), Importance (20%), Frequency (10%)

### 2. Dual-Instance Development Environment
- **Complete Isolation**: PRODUCTION (port 8000) and DEVELOPMENT (port 8001)
- **Environment Configuration**: Separate .env files for each environment
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear identification of active environment
- **Environment Manager**: Script for easy management (`./scripts/env-manager.sh`)
- **Safe Testing**: Changes in DEVELOPMENT don't affect PRODUCTION

### 3. Session Logging Enhancements
- **Improved Naming**: `YYYY-MM-DD-Project-Name.md` format
- **Folder Structure**: Year/month organization
- **Project-Local Vault**: Sessions stored in `./Project_Context/vault/`
- **Environment Tracking**: Sessions marked with environment metadata
- **Automatic Capture**: Enabled by default with auto-save on exit

### 4. Vault Management
- **Multi-Vault Support**: Register and switch between vaults
- **Vault Registry**: Persistent storage of vault configurations
- **Backup/Restore**: Full vault backup capabilities
- **Hot-Swapping**: Instant context switching between projects

### 5. State Management
- **State Capture**: Save complete working context
- **State Restoration**: Return to previous states
- **State Comparison**: Diff between states
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Expiration and size management

### 6. Platform Foundation
- **Obsidian Integration**: Full note management capabilities
- **Template System**: Import and manage documentation templates
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time system health checks
- **Vault Index**: Comprehensive statistics and navigation

## üöß In Progress

### Hierarchical Memory System (Phase 2, Day 6-10)
**Status**: Ready to implement in DEVELOPMENT environment

**Planned Architecture**:
- **Working Memory**: Hot data, <48 hours, frequent access
- **Session Memory**: Warm data, 2-14 days, moderate access
- **Long-term Memory**: Cold data, >14 days, archival

**Implementation Plan**:
1. ‚úÖ Environment setup complete
2. ‚è≥ Add tier infrastructure to EnhancedMemoryManager
3. ‚è≥ Implement tier determination logic
4. ‚è≥ Create multi-tier query system
5. ‚è≥ Build migration service

## üìÖ Upcoming Features

### Phase 3: Intelligence Layer (Days 11-15)
- Pattern recognition from development habits
- Intelligent session processing
- Git integration for commit-aware memories
- Background service coordination

### Phase 4: Polish and Deployment (Days 16-20)
- Comprehensive testing suite
- Performance optimization
- Documentation completion
- Production release preparation

## üîÑ Recent Changes (This Session)

### Configuration Updates
- Moved to project-local vault structure
- Created dual-instance development setup
- Enhanced session logging format
- Added environment awareness throughout

### Code Changes
- Updated `config.ts` for environment detection
- Modified `session-logger.ts` for better naming
- Enhanced `memory-manager-enhanced.ts` with safety checks
- Created environment management scripts

### Documentation
- Created `MEMORY_USAGE_GUIDE.md`
- Created `DUAL_INSTANCE_SETUP.md`
- Updated `README.md` with new configurations
- Created vault structure documentation

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)
1. Begin hierarchical memory implementation in DEVELOPMENT
2. Create tier infrastructure in EnhancedMemoryManager
3. Test tier determination logic

### This Week
1. Complete multi-tier query implementation
2. Build migration service for automatic tier management
3. Test performance with large datasets
4. Document hierarchical system architecture

### This Month
1. Complete Phase 2 (Hierarchical Memory)
2. Implement Phase 3 (Intelligence Layer)
3. Begin Phase 4 (Polish and Deploy)
4. Prepare for v2.0 release

## üí° Key Decisions Made

1. **In-Place Modification**: Modify EnhancedMemoryManager directly rather than creating v2
2. **Feature Flags**: Use configuration to enable/disable features
3. **Project-Local Vault**: Keep all data within project structure
4. **Dual-Instance**: Complete isolation for safe development

## üìä Platform Statistics

- **Total Code Files**: 25+
- **Documentation Files**: 30+
- **Test Coverage**: Growing
- **Active Features**: 15+
- **Development Time**: 20-day roadmap (Day 6 in progress)

## üîß Development Environment

### Requirements
- Node.js 20+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- ChromaDB (two instances)
- OpenAI API Key

### Quick Start
```bash
# Start development environment
./scripts/env-manager.sh start-dev

# Check status
./scripts/env-manager.sh status

# Run in development mode
./scripts/test-hierarchical.sh
```
