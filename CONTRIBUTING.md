## Development Process

### Working on Platform v2.1

1. **Setup your development environment**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mcp-chromadb-memory.git
   cd mcp-chromadb-memory
   
   # Platform development happens on this branch
   git checkout feature/platform-foundation
   git pull origin feature/platform-foundation
   
   npm install
   ```

2. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   # Branch from platform transformation, not main
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Follow the existing code style
   - Add tests for new functionality
