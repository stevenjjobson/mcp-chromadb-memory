## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation Details

### Dual-Instance Development Environment
- **PRODUCTION**: Port 8000 - Live system with real data
- **DEVELOPMENT**: Port 8001 - Isolated testing environment
- Separate Docker containers and .env files
- Environment management script: `scripts/env-manager.sh`

### Hierarchical Memory System
- **Architecture**: Three-tier system with automatic migration
- **Configuration**: Feature flag `TIER_ENABLED=true`
- **Implementation Files**:
  - `src/memory-manager-enhanced.ts` - Core tier logic
  - `src/services/migration-service.ts` - Automatic migration
  - Various tier management scripts in `scripts/`

### Session Logging Updates
- Filename format: YYYY-MM-DD (full year)
- Vault path: Project-local `./Project_Context/vault/Sessions/`
- Auto-start enabled in production

## üìä Metrics

### Code Coverage
- Core functionality: ~80%
- Tier system: ~75%
- Integration tests: ~60%

### Performance
- Working memory queries: <10ms ‚úÖ
- Cross-tier queries: <50ms ‚úÖ
- State operations: <200ms ‚úÖ
- Background CPU usage: <3% ‚úÖ

### Memory Distribution (Production)
- Working tier: Active (0-48h memories)
- Session tier: Ready (48h-14d memories)
- Long-term tier: Ready (14d+ memories)

## üîÑ Recent Changes (2025-01-07)

1. **Hierarchical Memory Implementation**
   - Completed three-tier architecture
   - Deployed to production
   - Migrated existing memories

2. **Environment Isolation**
   - Created dual-instance setup
   - Separate development environment
   - Clear naming conventions

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated README with tier system
   - Created this status document
   - Stored session context memory

## üéØ Next Session Goals

1. Begin Phase 3: Intelligence Layer
2. Start with Session Processor Enhancement
3. Implement pattern extraction capabilities
4. Set up foundation for pattern recognition

## üìù Notes

- The old `ai_memories` collection still exists but is unused
- Migration service runs hourly in production
- All existing tools remain backward compatible
- Feature flags allow gradual rollout of new features
